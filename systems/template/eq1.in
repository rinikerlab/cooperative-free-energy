A NVT simulation for common production-level simulations
 &cntrl
    imin=0,        ! No minimization
    irest=0,       ! This is NOT a restart of an old MD simulation
    ntx=1,         ! So our inpcrd file has no velocities

    ! Temperature control
    ntt=3,         ! Langevin dynamics
    gamma_ln=1.0,  ! Friction coefficient (ps^-1)
    tempi=310,   ! Initial temp -- give it some small random velocities
    temp0=310,   ! Target temperature

    ! Potential energy control
    cut=9.0,       ! nonbonded cutoff, in Angstroms

    ! MD settings
    nstlim=25000,  ! 25K steps, 25 ps total
    dt=0.001,      ! time step (ps)

    ! SHAKE
    ntc=2,         ! Constrain bonds containing hydrogen
    ntf=2,         ! Do not calculate forces of bonds containing hydrogen

    ! Control how often information is printed
    ntpr=1000,     ! Print energies every 1000 steps
    ntwx=1000,     ! Print coordinates every 1000 steps to the trajectory
    ntwr=10000,    ! Print a restart file every 10K steps (can be less frequent)
!   ntwv=-1,       ! Uncomment to also print velocities to trajectory
!   ntwf=-1,       ! Uncomment to also print forces to trajectory
    ntxo=2,        ! Write NetCDF format
    ioutfm=1,      ! Write NetCDF format (always do this!)

    ! Wrap coordinates when printing them to the same unit cell
    iwrap=0,

    ! Restraint options
    ntr=1,         ! Positional restraints for proteins, sugars, ligands, and lipid head groups
    restraint_wt=10.0, ! (force constant for restraint)
    restraintmask=':1-NRES', !(atoms in residues 1-152 restrained)

    ! Set water atom/residue names for SETTLE recognitionProtein posres
  !  watnam='WAT',  ! Water residues are named WAT
  ! owtnm='O',     ! Water oxygens are named O
